                    "During economic downturns, gasoline inflation tends to have a complex relationship with overall inflation. Initially, economic slowdowns can lead to reduced demand for gasoline, causing its inflation rate to decrease. However, prolonged downturns may also impact overall inflation negatively due to broader economic contractions affecting consumer spending and business operations.",
                    "During economic recoveries, gasoline inflation tends to rise alongside overall inflation as demand for fuel increases with economic activity. This relationship underscores the role of energy prices in broader economic recoveries.",
                    "During economic downturns, increases in gasoline prices often contribute to higher overall inflation due to their direct impact on transportation costs and indirect influence on other sectors through increased production and transportation costs.",
                    "During economic recoveries, gasoline inflation often rises as demand for energy increases alongside economic activity, contributing to overall inflation but also signaling improving consumer confidence and business expansion."
